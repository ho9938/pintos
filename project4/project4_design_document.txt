		     INDEXED AND EXTENSIBLE FILES
		     ============================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

struct inode_disk
  {
	  block_sector_t table_one;           /* sector for first inode table */
  };

/* On-disk table which contains sector number to second table or data */
struct inode_table_disk
{
		block_sector_t table_two[BLOCK_TABLE_SIZE];		/* table for blocks */
};

>> A2: What is the maximum size of a file supported by your inode
>> structure?  Show your work.

My inode structure has doubly-indexed structure. struct inode_disk has sector number
for first inode table, which has BLOCK_SECTOR_SIZE / sizeof (block_sector_t) = 128 = 2^7
entries. Each entry has sector number for second inode table, which has 2^7 entries.
Each entry has sector number for data block, which has 512 = 2^9 bytes of data.
Thus, one inode has maximum 2^7 * 2^7 * 2^9 = 2^23 bytes = 8MB.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A3: Explain how your code avoids a race if two processes attempt to
>> extend a file at the same time.

It can be implemented by a lock. To extend a file, CPU acquires own lock
of the inode. After extension, it releases a lock.

Likewise, it can be implemented by a lock. To extend a file, CPU acquires 
own lock of the inode. After extension, it releases a lock.

>> A5: Explain how your synchronization design provides "fairness".

To guarantee fairness, it may have some queue for lock acquirement. However,
this implementation will make structure complicated and make more overhead.
So I didn't contain this functionality.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Is your inode structure a multilevel index?  If so, why did you

>> indirect blocks?  If not, why did you choose an alternative inode

I chose doubly indirect blocks because my inode implementation must
allow maximum file size 8MB. It can be implemented only if index level
is larger than 1. Bigger size level has big overhead, so I chose doubly
indirect blocks.

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.
